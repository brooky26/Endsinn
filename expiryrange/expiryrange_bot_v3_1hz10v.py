Deriv EXPIRYRANGE MC Bot v3 — 1HZ10V only (RDBEAR dropped, see v3 notes below)
================================================
Fixes applied vs v1 (confirmed from Railway logs):

  BUG 1 — GARCH vol unit error (ROOT CAUSE of ±0.30 barriers on 9648-priced asset)
    GARCH is fitted on RELATIVE returns scaled by 1000.
    vol_per_tick from GARCH came out as ~0.000018 (relative units / 1000).
    The MC used this directly as absolute price units → barrier = 0.40 * 0.000018 * sqrt(120)
    = 0.000079 price units → all 75K paths trivially inside → win=1.000.
    FIX: convert relative vol back to absolute: abs_vol = (garch_vol / scale) * price.
    Also added a hard sanity check: if abs_vol_per_tick < 0.01 * price/1000, abort and
    fall back to std(price_diffs) directly (no relative-return conversion).

  BUG 2 — Proposal API payout misread ($2.18 returned instead of $0.18)
    Deriv's proposal response for EXPIRYRANGE returns:
      { "proposal": { "ask_price": 0.35, "payout": 2.53, ... } }
    "payout" is the TOTAL payout if won (stake + profit), not net profit.
    Code did total - BASE_STAKE = 2.53 - 0.35 = $2.18 — WRONG because ask_price
    for EXPIRYRANGE is NOT always equal to stake (Deriv may adjust it).
    FIX: net_profit = payout - ask_price (use the actual ask price from the response).
    Also: cap sanity check — if net_profit > stake * 20, something is still wrong → skip.

  BUG 3 — Supabase column mismatch (PGRST204 on 'actual_payout')
    The SQL schema used column name 'actual_payout' but the original schema.sql
    had different column names. The schema.sql we provided had 'actual_payout'
    but the user's Supabase table was created from the FIRST schema which used
    'breach_prob' and 'ev_conservative' etc without 'actual_payout', 'mc_win_prob',
    'mc_ci_lower', 'barrier_sigma', 'hawkes_val'.
    FIX: simplified log record to only columns that exist in the ORIGINAL schema,
    plus a graceful column-mismatch fallback that logs what it can.

  BUG 4 — ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 2)
    After refactor, execute_expiryrange returned 3-tuple (won, profit, placed)
    but some call sites still unpacked 2 values.
    FIX: all call sites updated; consistent 3-tuple everywhere.

  BUG 5 — Watchdog restarting too aggressively (4.5 min timeout, GARCH takes 3+ min)
    FIX: WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT raised to 15 minutes; last_activity reset after GARCH fit.

  BUG 6 — Bootstrap only loading 1000 ticks (HISTORY_BOOTSTRAP was 5000 but API
    silently returned 1000 — Deriv caps ticks_history at 5000 max but the count=5000
    call was working; however GARCH needs MIN_TICKS_FOR_FIT=200 and was getting it.
    The real issue: GARCH on RELATIVE returns of a 9648-priced asset with scale=1000
    gives conditional vol in units of (relative_return * 1000), not price.
    This is fixed by BUG 1 fix.

  BUG 7 — Unicode box-drawing chars split by Railway logger into individual lines
    FIX: all separators switched to plain ASCII hyphens/equals.

ARCHITECTURE (unchanged):
  4-stage filter: Gate → MC optimizer → Proposal API payout check → Execute
  Daily self-improvement: midnight UTC, Bayesian reweighting of dur/barrier prefs
  Supabase: all trades logged, config warm-started on restart

v3 CHANGES (2026-07-27) — fixes candidate scarcity, adds HMM/GBM engine:

  SCARCITY ROOT CAUSE — three independent binary gates were stacked, each
  cutting the surviving set, and the tightest of them left almost no room:
    1. MC_REQUIRED_WIN=0.58 vs MC_MAX_WIN_PROB~0.628 (derived from
       MIN_NET_PAYOUT/BASE_STAKE fair-odds math) left only a ~4.8-point-wide
       win_prob band as analytically acceptable, BEFORE any live pricing
       was even checked.
    2. structural_gate()'s 5 conditions (ADX/vol_trust/MBS/Bollinger/Hawkes)
       must ALL pass simultaneously.
    3. The live proposal then had to clear a fixed-dollar MIN_NET_PAYOUT
       floor, all-or-nothing.
    4. classify_regime() (rule-based on ADX/Hawkes thresholds) narrowed the
       duration/sigma grid further depending on which of 4 discrete regime
       buckets the market happened to be in.
  Any one of these being restrictive was fine; ALL FOUR compounding is why
  qualifying candidates were rare even with a reasonably fine grid.

  CHANGE 1 — SYMBOLS restricted to 1HZ10V only (RDBEAR dropped). Frees up
    the full per-cycle compute/API budget for one symbol.

  CHANGE 2 — Finer, wider sweep grids (DURATION_CANDIDATES, BARRIER_SIGMAS)
    so more of the space is sampled per cycle without touching the edge
    bar itself.

  CHANGE 3 — The analytical MC_REQUIRED_WIN/MC_MAX_WIN_PROB band is now a
    loose sanity pre-filter only (avoids wasting proposal-API calls on
    obviously-bad candidates). The actual accept/reject decision moved
    downstream to the LIVE proposal EV, which is the only number that
    reflects Deriv's real (house-margin-inclusive) pricing anyway.

  CHANGE 4 — rank_candidates_by_ev() no longer hard-excludes candidates
    below a fixed MIN_NET_PAYOUT floor. Any candidate with genuine positive
    EV trades; edge magnitude (edge_frac = ev/ask_price) continuously scales
    the stake instead of gating trade/no-trade. NOTE: Deriv's own minimum
    stake ($0.35 = BASE_STAKE) is a hard floor -- "trade marginal edges
    small" cannot mean below $0.35, so scaling runs BASE_STAKE upward with
    edge strength (capped at STAKE_MULT_MAX) rather than downward. This
    still stops good-but-marginal edges from being thrown away; it just
    can't go below the platform's own minimum.

  CHANGE 5 — Added SimpleHMM2 (a dependency-free 2-state Gaussian HMM,
    consistent with this file's self-built-statistics style -- GARCH via
    `arch` remains the only external stats dependency) and a regime-
    conditional GBM sampler (hmm_gbm_terminal_samples). Each MC cycle now
    blends TWO terminal-distribution sources at equal weight: the existing
    historical block-bootstrap (empirical shape/fat-tails) and the new
    HMM/GBM sampler (regime-persistent lognormal paths, drift/vol drawn
    from whichever of the 2 fitted states the filter currently favours).
    This directly makes the HMM/GBM model a first-class input to which
    duration/barrier gets selected, not just a logging label.
    classify_regime()'s ADX/Hawkes buckets are kept as a DIAGNOSTIC print
    only now -- the full grid sweeps every cycle regardless of bucket,
    since dropping RDBEAR freed the compute budget this used to protect.

# pass/fail cliff.
#
# IMPORTANT ASYMMETRY: Deriv's own minimum stake is BASE_STAKE ($0.35) --
# that is a hard platform floor, not a tunable. "Let marginal edges trade
# small instead of discarding them" therefore can't mean sub-$0.35 stakes; it
# means marginal-but-positive edges trade AT the $0.35 floor instead of being

# ── Sweep grids ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# v3: widened to 30s steps end-to-end (was a hand-picked 7-value list) so the
# optimizer samples far more of the duration space per cycle -- this is the
# "widen the opportunity set" fix, independent of the edge-bar changes above.
DURATION_CANDIDATES = list(range(60, 481, 30))   # 60,90,...,480 (15 values)
# Barrier expressed as multiples of terminal vol. v3: finer step (0.05 instead
# of the old hand-picked list) across the same overall range, plus extending
# down to 0.30 now that the win_prob ceiling isn't artificially truncating
# the useful zone.
# v6 (2026-07-29): re-centered based on real log data + explicit user
# calibration. The 2026-07-29 log showed EV ranking consistently selecting
# the WIDEST sigmas in the old 0.30-2.00 grid (1.35-2.00 observed) because
# those have the highest win_prob and win_prob drives weighted_score/
# candidate ranking before live pricing is known -- but Deriv's real payout
# at those widths was $0.01-0.04 on a $0.35 stake (some even "offers no
# return"), giving strongly negative edge_frac every time (down to -0.078).
# The barriers were too safe/wide to be worth trading, and the ranking logic
# was actively steering toward exactly that failure mode.
#
# User-specified fix: absolute barrier should be +-1.69 to +-2.30 (price
# units) at the 2-minute (120s) duration. Converting via that cycle's own
# logged abs_vol_per_tick (0.16998, GARCH): vol_terminal(120s) =
# 0.16998 * sqrt(120) = 1.862, so target sigma = barrier_abs / vol_terminal
# = 1.69/1.862 .. 2.30/1.862 = 0.91 .. 1.24. Since sigma is ALREADY defined
# relative to vol_terminal (which itself scales as sqrt(duration)), this
# same sigma window is the best available generalization to every other
# duration in DURATION_CANDIDATES too -- vol_terminal does the duration
# scaling automatically, sigma is what stays constant across durations for
# a given "how strict" setting.
#
# Grid: 0.85-1.35 (mild padding either side of the 0.91-1.24 target so EV
# ranking still has real candidates to compare, not a single point) in 0.025

# full grid regardless of conditions. This directly targets the pattern
# flagged in the daily self-improvement log ("51 trades flagged negative EV
# at entry actually won 64.7%... positive EV trades won only 33.3%"), which

    Sweeps (duration × barrier_sigma × asym_ratio) grid.

    For each symmetric baseline barrier_abs, the asymmetry ratio splits it:
      upper_abs = barrier_abs * upper_ratio
      lower_abs = barrier_abs * lower_ratio

    The ratio pair is chosen from ASYM_RATIO_GRID for both sides independently,
    but biased by the directional signal:
      bias > 0 (up drift) → favour upper_ratio > 1, lower_ratio < 1
      bias < 0 (down drift) → favour lower_ratio > 1, upper_ratio < 1
      bias ≈ 0             → symmetric (1.0, 1.0) gets the most weight

    The drift is injected into the MC terminal distribution as a mean shift,
    so win_prob correctly reflects both the asymmetric window AND the drift.

    `gate_info` (from structural_gate(), computed this same cycle) is used

    combos are swept at all -- see classify_regime() / REGIME_DURATIONS /

    Fires a CALL (bias > 0, upper wider) or PUT (bias < 0, lower wider)
    contract for the same duration as the parent EXPIRYRANGE, using
    DIR_OVERLAY_STAKE_FRAC * EXPIRYRANGE_stake.

    Called ONLY when |bias| >= DIR_OVERLAY_BIAS_FLOOR. The EXPIRYRANGE
    contract has already been submitted — this runs concurrently after
    the buy call returns, so it does not block EXPIRYRANGE settlement.

    Logic:
      bias > 0  →  asymmetry pushed upper barrier up  →  CALL
                   (price drifted up over BIAS_LOOKBACK ticks and MC
                    expects it to continue; CALL wins if price ends above
                    entry at expiry)
      bias < 0  →  asymmetry pushed lower barrier down →  PUT
                   (price drifted down; PUT wins if price ends below entry)

    The two contracts are complementary but NOT a perfect hedge:
      - If price stays inside the EXPIRYRANGE window AND drifts in the
        bias direction: BOTH win.
      - If price drifts strongly in the bias direction but breaks the
        opposite barrier: EXPIRYRANGE loses, CALL/PUT wins (partial offset).
      - If price moves against the bias: EXPIRYRANGE may still win (wide
        window), CALL/PUT loses (small secondary stake = limited downside).
